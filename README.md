# Selective Overhead Mirroring

This is the third assignment of "Unix Systems Programming" course (spring 2017).

The main goal of this assignment is to create a *selective overhead mirroring application* , which will be capable of copying multiple directories from a remote Content Server to a selected machine (Mirror Server). This mirroring system consists of a series of web-based programs that all together achieve the desired file transfer. Individual programs should use threads to achieve data transfer.

Application comprises three main programs:
  * MirrorInitiator
  * MirrorServer
  * ContentServer


The following picture shows how the application works
